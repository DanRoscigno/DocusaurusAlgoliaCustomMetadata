# Manage roles in an account

CelerData employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage privileges within a CelerData cloud account.

> **NOTE**
>
> Only CelerData members with **Role Management** privilege can create or delete a role, or modify privileges for a role.

## Create a role

1. Sign in to the [CelerData Cloud Private console](https://cloud.celerdata.com/login).
2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Access Control > Roles**.
3. On the **Role Management** page, click **Create role**.
4. In the dialog box that appears, enter the role name, optionally add a description for the role, and click **Confirm**.

## Modify privileges for a role

You need to enable privileges for a new role that you have created because no privilege is enabled for it by default. You can also disable privileges for an existing role.

1. Sign in to the [CelerData Cloud Private console](https://cloud.celerdata.com/login).
2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Access Control > Roles**.
3. On the **Role Management** page, click the name of the role that you want to modify privileges for.
4. Click **Privileges** to enter the **Privileges** tab.
5. Click the switch in front of each privilege item to enable or disable it for the role.

## Delete a role

1. Sign in to the [CelerData Cloud Private console](https://cloud.celerdata.com/login).
2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Access Control > Roles**.
3. On the **Role Management** page, click the name of the role that you want to delete.
4. Click **Delete role**.
5. In the message that appears, click **Confirm**.
