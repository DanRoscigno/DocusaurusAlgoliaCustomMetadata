# Use Free Trial

When you [create a CelerData cloud account](../get_started/sign-up_or_sign-in.md), you can try some CelerData services free of charge with certain usage limits. This topic outlines the rules, limits, and notifications involved in the timeline of a free trial, and how to apply for a free trial extension.

> **NOTE**
>
> All the time-related information hereinafter refers to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

## Free trial timeline

CelerData offers a 30-day free trial for each account following your initial sign-up date to it.

### Before free trial

When you create an account and log in for the first time, a pop-up message informs you about the start of your free trial period.

### During free trial

During the 30 days of the free trial, you can access the CelerData platform and use all display features and limited interactive features.

While the usage within your account is continuously measured in CelerData Cloud Units (CCUs) during the free trial, the billing of the account is set permanently to $0. You will not be charged throughout the free trial.

On Day 27, an email is sent to you and all members with the **View billing** privilege, stating that the free trial will expire in three days if no credit card has been added to the account or you have not applied for a free trial extension from our sales team at <a href = "mailto: cloud-support@celerdata.com">cloud-support@celerdata.com</a>.

On Day 30, a second email is sent to you and all members with the **View billing** privilege to state that the free trial will expire and how your clusters will be handled after expiration.

### Free trial expiration

Your free trial terminates at 23:59:59 UTC on the expiration date, which is 30 days after your initial sign-up date. When your free trial expires, all the clusters created within your account are suspended, and all members within your account are automatically logged out.

### After free trial expiration

After the free trial expires, you can still re-log in to your account. However, most features of the CelerData platform are disabled to you, and you only have limited access to CelerData. Additionally, the usage of your account is reset to 0 CCU. Upon login, a pop-up message informs you the free trial has ended and redirects you to the page where you can update your credit card information.

## Apply for a free trial extension

If you want to extend your free trial, please contact our sales team at <a href = "mailto: cloud-support@celerdata.com">cloud-support@celerdata.com</a>.

Extensions can be granted regardless of whether a credit card has been added, and no charges will be incurred before the end of the extended free trial.
