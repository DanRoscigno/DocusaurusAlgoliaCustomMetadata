# Website

Test site deployed with Netlify.

Prod URL is https://docs.galacticbase.com

Algolia crawls the site under the Docsearch program

DNS is setup so that I can use the CNAME docs.galacticbase.com; the Netlify hostname is startling-narwhal-a89c08, which is a pretty cool name, but I registered docs.galacticbase.com with the Algolia folks and the crawler is locked to that.

Goal 1: Get Algolia working with basic functionality

Goal 2: Add keywords and descriptions to the pages and get those indexed

Goal 3: Get page ranking working so that tutorial type content can be ranked above reference content

Goal 4: Add Pinyin words to keywords (or maybe a new meta field?) and get those indexed and searchable
